    <string name="about_text">
    The Gaslands Builder was created because I wanted to learn how to write Android apps. Its source
        code is open on GitHub.
    I had great fun with it and it is highly possible that the app will develop.</string>
    <string name="about_support">If you like the app, find it useful and want to support and encourage my efforts click the
        button on top. I would appreciate stars and watchers on my GitHub account. You could also donate money to UNESCO.
